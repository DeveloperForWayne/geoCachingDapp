#GeoCacheth
#A Geocaching App based on Ethereum Network

This is a geocaching app based on Ethereum blockchain. Any and each geocacher, item and cache has a ethereum address pointing to a smart contract. All variables needed to manage this app are states of smart contracs in a blockchain; thus the history of state changes  are immutable and is available readily from any part of the world.

The correct branch is subBranch_2.
